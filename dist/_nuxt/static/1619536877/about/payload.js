Students are given a broad interdisciplinary grounding in the skills, concepts, and hands-on experiences they will need to engage the potentials of new technologies in art making. Every other week, a lecture and discussion group exposes students to concepts of electronic media, perception, inter-media composition, emerging venues, and other issues important to artists working with technologically based media. Students will attend a morning & afternoon section each day to gain hands-on experience with a variety of forms and techniques central to technologically-based art making."}]},{type:a,value:e},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Displacement:"}]},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:"\nWhat happens when something is taken out of an established\u002F familiar\u002F expected\u002F native\u002F understood\u002F original context and placed somewhere else?
