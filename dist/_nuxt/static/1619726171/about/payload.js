Students are given a broad interdisciplinary grounding in the skills, concepts, and hands-on experiences they will need to engage the potentials of new technologies in art making. Every other week, a lecture and discussion group exposes students to concepts of electronic media, perception, inter-media composition, emerging venues, and other issues important to artists working with technologically based media. Students will attend a morning & afternoon section each day to gain hands-on experience with a variety of forms and techniques central to technologically-based art making."},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Displacement:"}]},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\nWhat happens when something is taken out of an established\u002F familiar\u002F expected\u002F native\u002F understood\u002F original context and placed somewhere else?

This can often be the result of war, political\u002Feconomic circumstance or environmental disaster. It can also be the result of innovation, appropriation, remix, collage, advocacy and intervention.

What is it to re-contextualize? What is it to remake or re enact something in order to reconnect? What is it to look back? What is home and how does it influence you? How can you respond to the idea of transition, change, getting lost, finding your feet, and making repairs or amends, or indeed being at peace with that displacement?"},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\nKeep in mind that time-based mediums are quite effective modes of capturing and exhibiting displacement. When one engages with a video or a web-based work, one must agree to displace their sense of time-space. The time spent immersed in a temporal artwork feels different than the time spent doing some other mundane task. For this project, students considered the ways in which video and web-based work can remove an audience member from their normal sense of temporal reality and transport them to another place and time."},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Instructors:"}]},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\nChristine Shallenberg"},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\nKristin McWharter"},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\nKelly Xi (TA)"},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:d},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[]}]}]},dir:"\u002Fen",path:"\u002Fen\u002Fabout",extension:".md",createdAt:h,updatedAt:h,to:"\u002Fabout"},contentType:e,prev:{slug:"_SongAngela",title:"Angela Song",to:"\u002F_SongAngela"},next:f}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("element","text","br","\n","about",null,"strong","2021-04-29T19:42:48.758Z")));
